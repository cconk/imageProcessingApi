# imageProcessingApi
Udacity project

# description
Images should be processed using the api/images/process and including filename, height and width parameters. All parameters are required for the api to process. If not all parameters are given a message should be displayed in the browser window. Other considerations included adding the feature of allowing for files to be saved in multiple sizes by concatenating the filename with height and width.
